      Surely, right? It seems that almost everyone says this. And that almost everyone reccomends it

      Well...

        This is probably what you should care about most. Manjaro has a track record of
        <em>really</em> poor security.

          Manjaro has let their SSL certificate expire (twice!).

        open a terminal

      <p>This doesn't really need any further explanation.</p>
      <p>
        Holding packages also causes security issues, but that is better addressed in the Stability
        section.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Stability</summary>
      <p>
        I have used both Manjaro and Arch, and have had almost no issues on Arch. Manjaro required
        constant coaxing. Isn't that what Manjaro is trying to <span class="quote">solve</span>?
      </p>
      <h2>Holding packages for two weeks</h2>
      <p>
        You've probably seen across their resources that Manjaro holds Arch packages behind for two
        weeks. Stability is touted as the main reason for this, but this doesn't really add up.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, what this actually means is that software upgrades reach you later for seemingly
        no reason. That's getting bug fixes, security patches, new features two whole weeks late.
        Aside from the obvious downside this brings, it also causes a more insidious issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure one of the reasons you're gravitating towards Manjaro is the AUR. Being able to
        run install scripts for anything sure sounds neat, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, most of these scripts are written with the assumption that you aren't running a system
        that's effectively two weeks out of date. This causes
        <a class="cursor-help"
          href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported" rel="noopener"
          target="_blank">partial upgrades</a>, which are unsupported. At best, that
        program won't install properly, and at worst it can wreak havoc across your entire system
        with no obvious way to fix it.
      </p>

      <summary>Management</summary>
      <h2>Funding</h2>
      <p>
        More recently, Manjaro had a controversy with their treasurer. A team member had purchased a
        gaming laptop, and the treasurer asked to clarify this purchase.
        <a href="https://redd.it/hxp3zi">This ultimately resulted in the treasurer being removed.</a>
        The project <em>treasurer</em> was removed for asking someone to justify an expense filed
        under the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cool and normal, right?
      </p>

      <summary>DDoSing the AUR (yes, seriously)</summary>
      <h2>Pamac sends thousands of requests</h2>
      <p>
        Manjaro's AUR helper, pamac, shipped a version with a bug that accidentally sent thousands
        of requests to the AUR per user. This rendered the AUR offline for <em>all</em> users across
        every Arch-based distro for a few hours.

        While this absolutely was not intentional, this highlights their poor QA testing.

    <h2>Quick things</h2>
    <p>
      I know what I've written here can be seen as inflammatory, but that's not really my intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've written this to have a resource to quickly point to the next time someone says
      <span class="quote">should i use manjaro??</span> in a chat room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maintaining a distro is commendable, and that alone takes credit. However, I'd rather not have
      your time (and others, when Manjaro inevitably breaks, and you need to ask for help) wasted,
      trying to figure out the odd quirks and issues that Manjaro causes.
